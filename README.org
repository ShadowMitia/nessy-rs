* A NES emulator

** Usage (WIP)

You can run the emulot and test it against nestest by running without argument

```
cargo run 
```

You can pass a ROM, but it won't do anything interesting for now.

```
cargo run [PATH_TO_ROM]
```

** Development

```
git clone github.com/shadowMitia/nessy-rs
cd nessy-rs
cargo build
```

** 6502 NES CPU

Passes NESTEST (99.9%)
Still missing a few unofficial instructions though...
